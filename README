ncUtil: A CLI wrapper for notCrypto
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Having a bunch of functions in a library is great but you need
to use them somehow. And with that I give you ncUtil.

Download and compile the tool with get.

Usage:
	./ncUtil -[ed] [-f file] [-k "key"]

Usage of ./ncUtil:
  -d=false: Pass for decoding
  -e=false: Pass for encoding
  -f="": Location of file to operate on
  -k="": Key to be used for operation
  -m="": Message to be used
